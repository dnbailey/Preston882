<p> I was originally born in Pennsylvania, however, I moved to Tennessee at
        an early age. Here I began my coding career. As a young child I always
        loved to take things apart and see how long it would take for me to put
        them back together exactly how it was. When I was 10 years old I built
        and programmed a robot from an arcade game that my grandmother had given
        me. At this time, being a young child I liked playing video games. Here,
        I was introduced to 'ROBLOX' where I began scripting in the LUA
        language. This opened a new portal of creativity due to the fact of,
        when I coded something I could actively see what it was that was being
        written out. Since this opportunity was given to me I have never been
        more excited to explore the possibilities with coding. I am very eager
        to learn as much as I possibly can while also using what I know to
        strengthen the community. Throughout this time I have thought of
        multiple paths and end results, which include, Achieving a Master's
        Degree in Computer Science at East Tennessee State University, landing a
        job in the Technological industry, and creating a software that will
        better the worldwide programming environment.</p>
